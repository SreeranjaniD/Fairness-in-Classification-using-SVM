# Fairness-in-Classification-using-SVM
Final Project in ECE 532 Matrix Methods in Machine Learning, University of Wisconsin-Madison

## Team members
Sreeranjani Didugu, Sandeep Kumar Ramani, Bastin Joseph

## Problem Statement
Introduce a notion of fairness to train a SVM binary classifier which
maximizes the margin subject to additional fairness constraints during the training process

## Goals:
1. Understand the various causes of bias in machine learning system.
2. Introduce a new type of fairness regularizer and learn it effects.
3. Implement the fair classifier using SVMs and analyze the model.
4. Analyze the tradeoff between fairness and accuracy.
